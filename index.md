### More Projects in Jupyter Notebook
- [Blight Ticket Compliance Prediction](https://github.com/tuttoaposto/U_Michi_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_Specialization_3/blob/master/3.4_Applied_ML_Blight_Ticket_Prediction.ipynb)
  - Predict which violators would pay for the ticket ontime or not.      
- [Ann Arbor Weather Analysis](https://github.com/tuttoaposto/U_Michi_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_Specialization_2/blob/master/2.4_Applied_Plot_Ann_Arbor_Weather_Analysis.ipynb)
  - Tell a story about Ann Arbor's weather and make a recommendation of when to visit the city.      
- [Interactive Plot](https://github.com/tuttoaposto/U_Michi_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_Specialization_2/blob/master/2.3_Applied_Plot_Interactive_Bar_Plot.ipynb)
  - The barplot colors change interactively with user's input as an effective visualization. When the user sets a cutoff value that is below the 95% CI, the bar will have a deep red color; if cutoff value is above the CI, the bar will have a deep blue color; if the cutoff value is within the CI, the bar will have an intermediate color depending on what percentage of the CI is above the cutoff value.    
- [Sampling Animation](https://github.com/tuttoaposto/U_Michi_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_Specialization_2/blob/master/2.3_Applied_Plot_Sampling_Animation.ipynb)
  - Animate the sampling of a normal distribution. User can adjust the sample size, mean and standard divation of the distribution, and start, stop and reset the animation.
