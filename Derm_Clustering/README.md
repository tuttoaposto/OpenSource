# Dermatology Clustering

#### Open Source Projects

Projects saved here are for practicing data science concepts using open source data
- Aim at understanding the features for different types of dermatology diseases
- Techniques include PCA and K-Means clustering

1. Screen plot to check importance of principal components, and how much information will be thrown away if use only first 2 -3 PCs to visualize data ![Scree](C:\Users\tuttoaposto\Desktop\My_Py_Projects\OpenSource\Derm_Clustering\Derm_ScreePlot.png)
2. Underlying features for the PC -- are they mostly clinical or histopathological? ![Features](C:\Users\tuttoaposto\Desktop\My_Py_Projects\OpenSource\Derm_Clustering\Derm_PC1_Features.png)
3. 3D scatter plot for K-Means clustering of the first three PCs to entertain human eyes ![3d](C:\Users\tuttoaposto\Desktop\My_Py_Projects\OpenSource\Derm_Clustering\Derm_3D_KMeans.png)
4. Besides K-Means, are better ways to cluster this data? ![compare clustering](C:\Users\tuttoaposto\Desktop\My_Py_Projects\OpenSource\Derm_Clustering\Derm_Compare_Clustering.png)
